## FAQ

### What is PyPass?

PyPass is a password manager and password generator made with python. It currently only supports CLI interfaces but may support GUI in the future.

### How secure is PyPass?

Currently, it is as secure as the python `random.SystemRandom` function. I don't know how secure that is, but I presume not very.
